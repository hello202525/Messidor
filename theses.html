  <p>A modern Great Schism is happening where present major business organizations will have to become media apparatuses.</p>

  <p>As technical moats between products continue to diminish, the far more pertinent skill will be distribution and capturing mindshare.</p>

  <p>It is imperative to have a controlling stake in this -- this means playing a role in architecting this future.</p>

  <p>For example, a16z has tried to build out media:</p>

  <p><strong>Attempts Include:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Investments:</strong> Clubhouse + Buzzfeed in investments (both were done when the passion was </li>
    <li><strong>In House:</strong> The Sunsetted Future (their in-house content studio, never gained true relevance)</li>
    <li><strong>High Profile Personality Investments:</strong> (defined by a16z hiring someone who has built profile apriori to a16z); Daniel Penny, Adam Neumann, Roy Lee</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These have achieved medium to moderate success. On the other hand, Thiel-world figures (Eric Weinstein, Peter Thiel, Blake Masters, Jesse Michaels) have all built and scaled media presence by focusing on topics that people actually care -- politics, heretical science, etc,</p>

  <p>This means opportunity.</p>

  <p>This is where the Messidor Fund enters.</p>

  <p>One unified, singular attempt -- through commerce culture, and content -- at capturing mindshare amongst the emerging pools of Elite Human Capital.</p>
