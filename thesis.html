A modern Great Schism is happening where present major business organizations will have to become media apparatuses.

As technical moats between products continue to diminish, the far more pertinent skill will be distribution and capturing mindshare. 

It is imperative to have a controlling stake in this -- this means playing a role in architecting this future. 

For example, a16z has tried to build out media:

Attempts Include: 
-> Investments: Clubhouse + Buzzfeed in investments (both were done when the passion was 
-> In House: The Sunsetted Future (their in-house content studio, never gained true relevance)
-> High Profile Personality Investments: (defined by a16z hiring someone who has built profile apriori to a16z); Daniel Penny, Adam Neumann, Roy Lee  

These have achieved medium to moderate success. On the other hand, Thiel-world figures (Eric Weinstein, Peter Thiel, Blake Masters, Jesse Michaels) have all built and scaled media presence by focusing on topics that people actually care -- politics, heretical science, etc,

This means opportunity. 

This is where the Messidor Fund enters. 

<strong>One unified, singular attempt -- through commerce culture, and content -- at capturing mindshare amongst the emerging pools of Elite Human Capital.</strong>
